**OBJECTIVE:**
Help independent podcasters who are overwhelmed by marketing and don't know how to grow their audience. They need immediate, actionable steps they can take today to get more listeners without requiring a marketing team or technical knowledge. Focus on turning one episode into multiple growth opportunities through strategic niche community targeting and authentic audience extension.

**PERSPECTIVE:**
Approach this analysis from the mindset of a supportive growth partner who:
- Understands the creator is likely solo, motivated, but overwhelmed by marketing options
- Knows they want practical advice, not theory or corporate jargon  
- Recognizes they need encouragement along with strategy
- Assumes they have limited time and resources
- Believes every podcast has potential if marketed to the right niche audiences
- Prioritizes long-tail growth strategy over competing in oversaturated broad communities
- Uses actual episode content as semantic foundation for strategic reach extension
- Makes recommendations copy-pasteable and immediately actionable
- Stays encouraging and avoids intimidating marketing jargon

SEMANTIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:
1. TRANSCRIPT FOUNDATION: Use the exact transcript text to establish deep semantic understanding of themes, emotions, and implicit meanings present in the content.

2. STRATEGIC REACH EXTENSION: Based on that semantic understanding, identify niche audience segments, specific communities (1K-100K members), and expanded keyword opportunities that connect to the core themes.

3. NICHE COMMUNITY STRATEGY: Prioritize smaller, engaged communities over massive generic ones. Growing podcasts succeed by winning in specific niches rather than competing in oversaturated broad communities.

4. SEO-DRIVEN AMPLIFICATION: Apply advanced SEO principles including keyword optimization, search intent matching, and multi-platform discoverability strategy for Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, YouTube, and web search.

5. AUTHENTIC AMPLIFICATION: Extend the episode's reach while preserving the authentic voice and core message - amplifying impact without changing identity.

EPISODE INFORMATION:
Episode Title: ${episodeTitle || 'New Episode'}
Podcast: ${podcastTitle || 'Podcast Growth Analysis'}

TRANSCRIPT:
${transcript}

SEO OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
- Front-load primary keywords in titles and descriptions for platform algorithms
- Target question-based keywords people actually search ("how to", "what is", "why does")
- Include semantic SEO terms that expand discoverability beyond exact keywords
- Optimize for multiple platforms: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, YouTube
- Use longtail keywords (3-5 words) with moderate search volume (100-1000/month)
- Include problem-solution keyword pairs that match listener search intent
- Add temporal and skill-level modifiers when relevant ("2024", "beginners", "advanced")

COMMUNITY TARGETING STRATEGY:
- Prioritize niche communities (1K-100K members) over massive generic ones
- Target problem-specific communities where episode content solves actual challenges  
- Focus on engaged, specialized audiences rather than broad, oversaturated spaces
- Consider specialized platforms beyond Reddit: Discord servers, Facebook groups, professional networks
- Use community directory knowledge as inspiration, not limitation - discover new communities that align with content

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- All quotes must be from actual transcript content
- Provide exactly 3 community suggestions targeting niche, engaged audiences (avoid r/podcasts, focus on r/restaurantowners)
- Provide exactly 3 cross-promo matches with actual podcasts and findable hosts in similar niches
- SEO keywords must be based on actual episode content with strategic search intent matching
- Titles and descriptions must balance keyword optimization with authentic voice
- All recommendations must enhance discoverability across podcast platforms and web search
- Maintain encouraging, expert-level marketing guidance throughout
- Focus on long-tail SEO and growth strategies for smaller podcasts competing against established shows

COMMUNITY TARGETING PRINCIPLES:
- Choose r/EtsySellers (95K) over r/Entrepreneur (1.8M) 
- Target r/restaurantowners (15K) over r/business (2.8M)
- Suggest specialized Discord servers over generic Facebook groups
- Prioritize problem-specific communities over demographic-broad ones
